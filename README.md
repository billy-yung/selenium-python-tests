Example Python scripts for testing webpages and APIs

## Introduction
Speed up your development by downloading an example script and replacing the relevant values with your endpoints.

## Usage
These scripts are all tested with Python 3.7 and Chrome Driver (make sure you match the version of your browser).
Screenshots are downloaded to your working directory.

### AppDynamics
Simply copy the test script of choice to a new Synthetic Job, select Python 3. For API tests, select browser of your choice (this will be instantiated but not used).
